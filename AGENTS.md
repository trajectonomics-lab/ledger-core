# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI coding agents in `trajectonomics-lab/ledger-core` (`@trajectonomics/ledger-core` on npm).

## Rules

1. Never commit to `main`. Branch (`feat/*`, `fix/*`, `docs/*`) and open a PR.
2. Never commit secrets or `.env` files. `NPM_TOKEN` lives in repo secrets only.
3. Pure package: no network, DOM, framework imports, database (no SQLite), CLI, sync metadata, or agent concerns. It is pure and deterministic: data in, data out, no I/O, no clock, no randomness, no ID generation (callers supply IDs). It is closed-world: no callbacks or plugin hooks. If real life does not fit, the fix is a new core primitive, never an extension point. `tsconfig.json` compiles `src` with no DOM, Node, or Bun types, so `fetch`/`process`/`document` fail typecheck; do not add `types` or `lib` entries to get around it.
4. Bun only: `bun install`, `bun test`, `bun run <script>`. Do not add npm/pnpm/yarn lockfiles.
5. Done means `bun run check` passes (Biome lint with zero warnings, strict typecheck, tests, build, publint + are-the-types-wrong). `bun run format` fixes formatting and import order. Do not loosen `tsconfig.base.json` or `biome.json` to make an error go away.
6. Never edit `version` in `package.json` and never run `npm publish` locally. Merges to `main` publish alphas; a stable release is the manual Release workflow. PR titles are conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `feat!:` ...) because they decide the next version (see README "Releasing").
7. Postponed work is tracked by the issue tracker, not by prose: file an issue, then leave `TODO(#<issue>)` at the code site it belongs to. Every unactioned `TODO` carries an issue number.

## Agent skills

### Reviewing a diff

`CODING_STANDARDS.md`: the conventions `bun run check` cannot enforce. Read it when reviewing, not when implementing.

### Issue tracker

GitHub Issues in `trajectonomics-lab/ledger-core`, via the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default five-role vocabulary (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: one `GLOSSARY.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

### Installing and updating skills

Skills come from [`mattpocock/skills`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) and [`trajectonomics-lab/internal-skills`](https://github.com/trajectonomics-lab/internal-skills) via the Vercel [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI and are pinned in `skills-lock.json`. The canonical copy is `.agents/skills/` (read natively by Codex, OpenCode, Pi, and Antigravity CLI); `.claude/skills/` holds symlinks into it for Claude Code. Never edit them by hand.

- Update: `npx skills update -p -y`
- Reinstall: `npx skills add mattpocock/skills --skill '*' -a claude-code codex opencode antigravity-cli pi -y`
- Restore from the lock: `npx skills experimental_install`
