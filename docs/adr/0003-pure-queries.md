# 0003. Pure queries: balances, net worth, P&L, trial balance

Status: accepted (issue #3)

## Context

Reports must derive from Transactions alone, as pure functions over in-memory arrays: no state, no I/O, deterministic output. Issue #3 left several choices open; they are fixed here. ADR-0002 deferred to this issue how Reversals show up in reports.

## Decisions

- **Queries take the chart as their trailing argument**, like the builders in ADR-0002. Account type, entity and hierarchy live only in the `ChartOfAccounts`, so "from the transactions alone" means "no stored state", not "no chart".
- **Collections are sorted arrays of plain rows**, never a Map or a record keyed by data, so order survives JSON. A query that also returns totals returns a plain object with fixed field names, e.g. `{ rows, totals }`, where `totals` is an array of `{ entityId, currency, amount }` sorted by `entityId` then `currency` (the trial balance's totals carry `debit` and `credit` instead of `amount`). Rows are ordered by `entityId`, `accountId`, then `currency`, compared by code unit. `localeCompare` and `Intl.Collator` are banned because they depend on the runtime's ICU data (see ADR-0001). Accounts have no name, so `accountId` is the only possible key.
- **Rows are raw signed amounts** (Debit `+`, Credit `-`) for every Account Type, in every query, with one stated exception: the trial balance's two columns. Natural sign appears only on named totals: net worth is assets minus liabilities and P&L is income minus expenses. This keeps ADR-0001's rule that a Posting's sign never depends on the Account Type, and means one account never has opposite signs in two outputs.
- **No `entityId` parameter.** A Transaction can span Entities, so callers cannot pre-filter Transactions by Entity. Rows carry `entityId`, nothing is netted across Entities, and statements are per `(Entity, Currency)`.
- **Reports include every Transaction.** A Reversal nets its original to zero algebraically; there is no void-pair detection and no `kind` field. This closes the "query concern" ADR-0002 deferred. A Reversal dated in a later period lands in that later period, so the earlier period still shows the mistake. This matches closed-period practice; to void within the original period, date the Reversal on the original's date (ADR-0002).
- **Dates are inclusive.** `asOf`, `from` and `to` are strings run through `parseISODate`. `from > to` throws.
- **Equity is outside net worth and P&L** and inside the trial balance. The identity `netWorth = -Σraw(equity) + profit-to-date` holds per `(Entity, Currency)` and is a property test. Profit-to-date is P&L over every Transaction dated on or before `asOf`, so `from` is optional in `profitAndLoss` and means "from the start".
- **Balances list Leaf Accounts only**, one row per chart Account including zero balances, so output shape does not depend on which accounts were touched. `balance` returns the same row as `balances` for one Account; an unknown id throws `UNKNOWN_ACCOUNT` and a Header id throws `NON_LEAF_ACCOUNT`. Each Account has one Currency, so `currency` never decides the order of `balances` rows. Header rollups are deferred to #14.
- **The trial balance** lists every Leaf Account's net Balance (not gross turnover), zero balances included. A positive Balance goes in the `debit` column and a negative one in the `credit` column as a magnitude, which is the one exception to raw rows. Totals per `(Entity, Currency)` are equal by construction; this is a property test and never a runtime check.
- **P&L dimensions.** `profitAndLoss(txs, { from, to, groupBy?, where? }, chart)`. `groupBy` takes one key and yields rows per `(Entity, Account, Currency, dimensionValue)` with `dimensionValue: string | null`, where `null` collects Postings lacking the key, so groups sum to the ungrouped total; `null` sorts first, then values by code unit. Without `groupBy`, rows are per `(Entity, Account, Currency)` for every Income and Expense Leaf Account, zeros included. With `groupBy`, only groups that exist appear. Totals are per `(Entity, Currency)` for every Income and Expense Leaf Account's pair, zeros included, in both modes, so their shape never depends on the data. `where` is exact-match on a `Record<string,string>`, ANDed, and a missing key never matches. Only P&L takes dimensions.
- **Queries re-check every Posting against the supplied chart**, throwing `UNKNOWN_ACCOUNT`, `NON_LEAF_ACCOUNT`, `CURRENCY_MISMATCH` and `UNBALANCED_TRANSACTION`. A Transaction is not tied to the chart that validated it, so a changed chart would otherwise silently misreport. This supersedes ADR-0001's consequence that queries "need not re-check these invariants". Transactions outside `asOf` or the period are re-checked too. Duplicate Transaction ids throw `DUPLICATE_TRANSACTION_ID`.
- **Amounts are `number`.** Sums use `BigInt` internally and every output (rows, rollups, totals) is checked against the safe-integer range. `bigint` is never exposed, because consumers serialize to JSON.
- **New error codes** are added for an inverted period and for an overflow, rather than reusing `INVALID_DATE` and `INVALID_AMOUNT`. The codes name the rule. This can break consumers with exhaustive `switch` statements over `LedgerErrorCode`; that is accepted and tracked by `TODO(#12)`.

## Considered Options

- **Header rollup rows inside `balances`, tagged with `kind`.** Rejected for now: a Header's children may use a different Currency, so its rows carry a currency that is not the account's own, and anyone summing the array double counts. A separate query can be added later without breaking anyone; changing `balances` later would. Tracked in #14.
- **Natural-sign rows for statements.** Rejected: the same account would show opposite signs in two outputs, the failure ADR-0002 exists to prevent.
- **Reusing `INVALID_DATE` and `INVALID_AMOUNT`.** Rejected in favour of dedicated codes.

## Consequences

- Changing the chart so a Leaf with Postings becomes a Header makes every query throw `NON_LEAF_ACCOUNT` on the old data. Callers must not turn a Leaf with history into a Header.
- Summing `balances` never double counts, because Headers never appear in it.
